Given an automata described with 
automata2 = ["d(q0,s)->q1", "d(q0,t)->q0", "d(q1,t)->q0", "d(q1, w)-> q2", "d(q2, t) -> q2", "d(q2, s) -> q3", "d(q3, w)->q0" , "finals:q1", "initials:q0, q2"]

where each entry is a transition 
transition(current_state, input_symbol) -> target_state

a dot graph will be created with the fsm as graphical representation
